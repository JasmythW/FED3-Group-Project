            <h2>What is Node.js?</h2>
                <p>Node.js is an asynchronous, cross-platform Javascript based runtime environment
                    for server and network-side applications. It is built on the V8 Javascript Engine,
                    or what powers Google Chrome, which is why Node.js is Javascript based.
                </p>
                <p>Also, Nodejs is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript, outside the web
                 browser, on a server.
                </p>
            <h4>Asynchronous</h4>
                <p>Executing tasks asynchronously means that you donâ€™t have to wait for a task to finish
                     before moving on to a different task. 
                </p>
                <p>The alternative is executing tasks synchronously and having to wait for one task to 
                    complete before moving on (ie. submitting a form in a web page and the UI blocks any
                     other tasks until the form has submitted).
                </p>
            <h4>V8 Javascript Engine</h4>
                <p>This is the engine that takes our JavaScript and executes it while browsing with Chrome.
                     It is independent of the browser in which the engine is being hosted.
                </p>
            <h4>Runtime Environment</h4>
                <p>A runtime environment is where the application code is ran. These also typically include
                     common libraries but do not include the capability to edit the code (this is done in a
                      development environment or code editor).
                </p>
        </div> 
    
        <div id="purpose">
            <h2>What is its purpose?</h2>
                <p>Node.js is designed to build fast and scalable network applications by employing push technology
                    over <b>WebSocket</b>.
                </p>
                <p><b>WebSocket</b> is a computer communications protocol, providing simultaneous two-way communication
                     channels over a single Transmission Control Protocol (standard that enables apps and devices
                      to exchange messages over a network) connection.
                </p>
                <p><b>In short:</b>Node.js allows web applications to have real-time, two way connections between client
                     and server. This allows them to initiate communication and exchange data more efficiently.</p>
            <h4>Good for</h4>
                    <p>Low processing applications such as a chat or a system monitoring dashboard.</p>
            <h4>Bad for</h4>
                    <p>Applications with CPU intensive processes like processing graphics, mathematical calculations, and video
                         or image compression.
                    </p>
        </div>
    
        <div id="important">
            <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
            <h4>Javascript Based</h4>
                <p>Because Node.js runs on the Javascript based V8 Engine, your interactive front end components and Node.js back end
                     components are written in the same language. This helps save time by avoiding converting functions or objects
                      into different languages.
                </p>
            <h4>Fast</h4>
                <p>Node.js is fast and lightweight because it works on tasks in a non-blocking,  asynchronous system. This means
                     that tasks can run at different times and more demanding tasks will not stop (or block) other functions. This
                      is helpful when completing longer wait time tasks (i.e. network accessing and file system accessing) because
                       Node.js will allow these tasks to run in the background and other tasks continue running.
                </p>
            <h4>Scalable</h4>
                <p>Node.js is highly scalable and is able to handle a growing amount of activity. It can handle many simultaneous
                     requests thanks to it&apos;s non-blocking I/O (input/output) system and it&apos;s single threaded <b>event loop</b>.
                </p>
                <p>The <b>event loop</b>is a continuous process that waits for and dispatches events/messages in a program. It keeps Node.js running,
                     responding to requests, and handling I/O operations without getting blocked.
                </p>
